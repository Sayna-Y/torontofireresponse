# An Analysis of the City of Toronto’s Fire Response between 2011–2019

The Great Fire of Toronto of 1904 is the largest fire in the city’s history (Toronto, 2022). One hundred buildings were destroyed, the equivalent of $337 million CAD in property damage was caused, and 5,000 people were put out of work; all at a time when the city had only 200,000 inhabitants (Toronto 2022). Previous incidents have led cities to introduce building codes, better planning, and further training for fire services employees (Rocha 2021). However, as cities continue to grow, the risk of urban fire grows every day. In the coming years, the Toronto Fire Services (TFS) anticipates several internal and external challenges that will have an impact on service delivery. Population growth, increasing vertical density, working in high-crime areas, the continued development of the city’s transit/subway network, and the nature of fires are all changing the firefighting landscape that TFS firefighters must manage daily (Toronto Fire Services, 2021).

The National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) specifies a maximum target incident response time of 6 minutes 24 seconds (Toronto Fire Service, 2019). In its 2019 Annual Report, Toronto Fire Services (TFS) stated that in more than 20% of the city’s 133,081 emergencies, TFS failed to reach incident sites within the NFPA standard (Toronto Fire Services, 2019).

Fire response times in the City of Toronto are understudied. Asgary et al. (2010)’s analysis in Toronto demonstrated clear spatiotemporal patterns of fire incidence but did not explore fire incidence’s relationships with fire service response time. Asgary et al. (2010) suggested that more detailed investigation involving fire response times and the presence of smoke alarms could save lives by informing policy decisions.

This project ultimately seeks to reveal whether there are patterns with Toronto’s fire response times that can be used by the City of Toronto to minimize response time and the risk of increased fire damage in the future.

The questions we hope to answer with our analysis and model are:

- How do TFS response times change temporally and spatially?
- Can we use temporal or spatial indicators to predict TFS response times?
